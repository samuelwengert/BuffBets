UAT Plan
___________________________________________________
1: The user adds a friend

The goal of this test is to show a fundamental part of the buff bets site, 
that is to search for a user, take that name and if it is actually a 
valid user, assign that person as a friend to the user.

If the user inputs an incorrect name, it will alert them that that doesn't 
exist and reprompt the search

Test Data:
We need the user id of the person, the username of the chosen friend,
and the friend id of said friend. The user id is a value stored via 
postgres sql as a serial value, the username of the chose friend is 
a value inputted via a post api request, and the friend id is the same
as a user id but just stored as a relation in another table inside 
postgres 

Test Environment:
We will be using Mocha and Chai for our testing. Mocha is the code that 
tests our set up and runs, chai is the code that verifies the tests either 
were or weren't successful.

Test Results:
The way we test the results is seeing that the index file outputs a 
200 value at the end of the code for a successful input of the friend
to the user and a 400 for if they put an incorrect name in.

Testers:
The testers for this will be the team building it which are all the people
inside the github users

2: The user makes an account

This is the first step to making any bets or making any friends, 
making a user. 

This entails the user having a form presented to them that will be 
creating their username, password.

If a username is already in use it should alert the user that 
they need to change their name and reprompt the form. 

Test Data:
The data needed will be all of the inputs from the user (username,
password, and balance) and the table of users with usernames that we
will be comparing against

Test Environment:
We will be using Mocha and Chai for our testing. Mocha is the code that 
tests our set up and runs, chai is the code that verifies the tests either 
were or weren't successful.

Test Results:
The way we test the results is seeing that the index file outputs a 
200 value at the end of the code for a successful input of a user
into the table and a 400 for if they put an existing users name.

Testers:
The testers for this will be the team building it which are all the people
inside the github users

3: The user places a bet

This is where the main functionality of what this application is for,
the user needs to make a bet. After wanting to place a bet on either
team (A or B which will be the name of a team), they will be prompted 
how much money from their base amount (for each user it is always 500)
and once they have put that amount in the place bet button will take them
back out, confirming the bet.

This will prompt an error if the user does not input a valid bet amount
which is between inclusively 5-100 dollars. 

It will also prompt an error if the user does not input a bet amount at 
all. 

It will also prompt an error if the user makes a bet more than the amount
they currently have in their balance.

Test Data:
We need the amount the user will bet (a value gathered from the front end),
the balance of the user (inside the Users table and found via user id),
And the user id.

Test Environment:
We will be using Mocha and Chai for our testing. Mocha is the code that 
tests our set up and runs, chai is the code that verifies the tests either 
were or weren't successful.

Test Results:
The way we test the results is seeing that the index file outputs a 
200 value at the end of the code for a successful place of a bet,
into the table and a 400 error for invalid amount, 401 for no bet,
402 for placing a bet more than the user's balance.

Testers:
The testers for this will be the team building it which are all the people
inside the github users
